# PRD: Packaging, Delivery, and Serving Strategy

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements and proposed architecture for packaging, delivering, and serving the `expert-enigma` Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The primary goal is to define a process that is simple, reliable, and easily automatable for both human developers and AI coding agents, with a specific focus on supporting multiple, concurrent projects.

## 2. Target Personas

1.  **The Developer:** A software engineer working on one or more Ruby repositories. They need a simple way to install the server and run isolated instances for each of their projects.
2.  **The Automated Agent (e.g., Gemini):** An LLM-based coding agent. It requires a programmatic and deterministic way to start, stop, and interact with a dedicated MCP server for a given workspace, without conflicting with other running servers.

## 3. Core Requirements & User Stories

### Packaging & Delivery

*   **As a Developer, I want** to install the server and all its dependencies with a single command, without worrying about system-level conflicts (especially for native extensions like `sqlite-vss` and `onnxruntime`).
*   **As an Automated Agent, I need** a self-contained, portable executable or image that guarantees a consistent runtime environment.

### Serving & Lifecycle Management

*   **As a Developer, I want** a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage the server's lifecycle (index, start, stop, status) on a per-project basis.
*   **As a Developer, I want** to run MCP servers for multiple projects simultaneously on my machine without them interfering with each other.
*   **As an Automated Agent, I need** to programmatically start a server for a specific repository on a dedicated port and receive a clear signal (e.g., a health check endpoint) when it is ready to accept requests.
*   **As an Automated Agent, I need** to manage the server as a background process that can be reliably terminated when my task is complete.

## 4. Proposed Architecture: Docker-First with a Project-Scoped CLI

To meet the requirements for portability, dependency management, and multi-project isolation, we propose a **Docker-first** distribution model. This approach encapsulates the entire runtime environment into a single, immutable image.

The server will be managed via a CLI designed to operate on a specific project directory. Each project will have its own isolated database and run on its own dedicated port, preventing data corruption and port collisions.

### 4.1. Database & State Isolation

To ensure projects do not interfere with each other, all state will be stored within the project's own directory.

*   **Database Location:** The indexer will create the database at `<project_path>/.expert_enigma/expert_enigma.db`.
*   **Project-Scoped Operations:** All CLI commands (`index`, `start`, etc.) will operate on the project directory they are pointed at, ensuring that indexing and serving are always correctly scoped.

### 4.2. Packaging: Docker Image

The application will be packaged as a Docker image.

*   **Base Image:** A standard Ruby image (e.g., `ruby:3.2-slim`).
*   **Dependencies:** The `Dockerfile` will handle all system and gem dependencies.
*   **Entrypoint:** The image's entry point will be a script that executes the CLI.

### 4.3. Delivery: Docker Hub

The official image will be published to Docker Hub, making it accessible via a standard `docker pull` command (e.g., `docker pull expert-enigma/server:latest`).

### 4.4. Serving: The `expert-enigma` CLI

A new CLI will be created to manage the server's state on a per-project basis.

**Proposed CLI Commands:**

| Command | Description | Example Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `expert-enigma index <path>` | Scans the repository at `<path>` and builds the database inside `<path>/.expert_enigma/`. This must be run before starting the server. | `expert-enigma index /path/to/my-project` |
| `expert-enigma start <path> [--port <port>]` | Starts the MCP server for the project at `<path>`. Assumes the database has been built. Defaults to port `65432` if not specified. | `expert-enigma start /path/to/my-project --port 8001` |
| `expert-enigma stop` | Stops the currently running server process. | `expert-enigma stop` |
| `expert-enigma status` | Reports whether the server is running and for which project. | `expert-enigma status` |
| `expert-enigma serve <path> [--port <port>]` | A convenience command that runs `index` if the database is missing, and then immediately runs `start`. | `expert-enigma serve /path/to/my-project --port 8001` |

## 5. User Installation and Setup Guide

This section describes the end-to-end process for a user to install and run the `expert-enigma` server.

### Step 1: Install Docker

First, ensure Docker is installed. Official instructions are available at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Step 2: Get the Docker Image

Users can get the image in one of two ways:

*   **Option A: Pull from Docker Hub (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    docker pull expert-enigma/server:latest
    ```
*   **Option B: Build from Source**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the project's source directory
    docker build -t expert-enigma/server:latest .
    ```

### Step 3: Install the Command-Line Wrapper

To provide a seamless, native-like CLI experience, users should install a wrapper script that handles the Docker commands.

1.  **Create the script file** in a directory that is part of the system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).
    ```bash
    sudo nano /usr/local/bin/expert-enigma
    ```

2.  **Add the following content** to the file. This script translates `expert-enigma` commands into the appropriate `docker run` calls, automatically mounting the current directory.
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # Wrapper script for running the expert-enigma MCP server via Docker.
    # This script mounts the current working directory into the container
    # and passes all command-line arguments to the server's CLI.
    #
    # Usage: expert-enigma [index|start|serve|stop|status] [options]
    #
    # Commands:
    #   index             Scans the current directory and builds the database
    #   start [--port N]  Starts the MCP server (detached mode, default port 65432)
    #   serve [--port N]  Convenience command that runs index if needed, then start
    #   stop              Stops the currently running server process
    #   status            Reports whether the server is running
    #
    # Options:
    #   --port <port>     Specify the port number (default: 65432)
    #

    set -e

    IMAGE_NAME="expert-enigma/server:latest"
    PROJECT_PATH="$(pwd)"
    DEFAULT_PORT=65432

    # Function to parse port from arguments
    parse_port() {

        while [ $i -lt ${#args[@]} ]; do
            if [ "${args[$i]}" = "--port" ]; then
                if [ $((i + 1)) -lt ${#args[@]} ]; then
                    port="${args[$((i + 1))]}"
                    # Validate port is a number
                    if ! [[ "$port" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
                        echo "Error: Port must be a number" >&2
                        exit 1

                    if [ "$port" -lt 1 ] || [ "$port" -gt 65535 ]; then
                        echo "Error: Port must be between 1 and 65535" >&2
                        exit 1

            show_usage

    esac
    ```

3.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/expert-enigma
    ```

### Step 4: Usage Example

With the wrapper installed, the server can be managed like any other CLI tool.

```bash
# Navigate to your Ruby project
cd /path/to/my-ruby-project

# Index the project (creates ./.expert_enigma/expert_enigma.db)
expert-enigma index

# Start the server for this project
expert-enigma start

# To run a server for a second project, open a new terminal:
# cd /path/to/another-project
# expert-enigma index
# expert-enigma start --port 8001
```

## 6. Example Workflow: Handling Multiple Projects (Automated Agent)

This workflow demonstrates how an agent would manage two separate MCP server instances for two different repositories.

### Project A

1.  **Index the Repository:** The agent mounts the first project into a container and runs the `index` command. The database is created at `/path/to/project-a/.expert_enigma/expert_enigma.db`.
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "/path/to/project-a:/app" expert-enigma/server:latest index /app
    ```

2.  **Start the Server:** The agent starts the server as a detached background process, mapping the container's internal port to `8001` on the host.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8001:65432 -v "/path/to/project-a:/app" --name project-a-mcp expert-enigma/server:latest start /app --port 65432
    ```

3.  **Interact with MCP for Project A:** The agent makes API calls to `http://localhost:8001`.

### Project B

1.  **Index the Repository:** In parallel, the agent indexes the second project. The database is created at `/path/to/project-b/.expert_enigma/expert_enigma.db`.
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "/path/to/project-b:/app" expert-enigma/server:latest index /app
    ```

2.  **Start the Server:** The agent starts a second, isolated server instance, mapping its port to `8002` on the host.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8002:65432 -v "/path/to/project-b:/app" --name project-b-mcp expert-enigma/server:latest start /app --port 65432
    ```

3.  **Interact with MCP for Project B:** The agent makes API calls to `http://localhost:8002`.

### Shutdown

Once finished, the agent stops and removes the containers by name.
```bash
docker stop project-a-mcp && docker rm project-a-mcp
docker stop project-b-mcp && docker rm project-b-mcp
```

## 7. Future Considerations

*   **Alternative Installation (RubyGems):** While Docker is primary, publishing a Gem would be beneficial for developers who prefer a non-Docker workflow. This would require providing clear instructions for installing the native dependencies.
*   **Configuration:** The server port and other settings could be configured via a `.expert_enigma.yml` file in the target repository or through environment variables.
*   **Incremental Indexing:** The `index` command could be enhanced with a `--watch` mode to support the real-time indexing feature mentioned in the `README.md`.
