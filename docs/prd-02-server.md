# PRD-02: [ABANDONED] Refactor MCP Server with Jimson Gem

## 1. Summary

This refactoring was planned to improve the stability and maintainability of the `mcp_server.rb` by replacing the Sinatra implementation with the `jimson` gem. However, during implementation, we discovered a fundamental incompatibility between the `jimson` gem and the execution environment. Even a minimal `jimson` server failed to start.

As a result, this refactoring has been abandoned. The project will continue to use the existing Sinatra-based implementation.
